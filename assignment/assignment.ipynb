        "## Q1 Responses:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A model is linear due to the direct relationship between the coefficients, independent variables, and the resulting dependent variables. The linearity comes from being able to see a proportional change in one variable as a result of tweaking another elsewhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The coefficient for a dummy variable displays the difference in the dependent variable between the category of value and the category we're referncing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Linear regression could be used for classiication, but more often than not it's not particularly useful. Regression is normally continuous, which contradicts the need for discrete values that are normally used in classification. Regression also assumes that there is a linear relationship between the variables in focus, while classification doesn't automatically assume that.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Some signs of overfitting are: A large bap between training and test performance, and a high R^2 on your training data.  \n",
        "\n",
        "5. Multicollinearity takes place when 2 or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated. The effect of this is that this makes it difficult to determine the true individual effect of each variable on the dependent variable because their movements are too similar.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. A way to incorporate nonlinear relationships bewteen the y and the x into my analyses is undertaking polynomial regression, due to its simplicity. Another way would be applying log and/or exponential functions to capute nonlinear effects, which is effective for power-law relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. The intercept represents the expected value of the y when all independent variables are zero. For the slope coefficient it is the expected change in y for a one-unit increase in x, holding all other variables constant. For a dummy variable it is how much y changes when the dummy variable is 1 instead of 0, keeping other variables constant.\n"

We would like to understand how that outcome is predicted by characteristics of the defendant, particularly race. Let's be very careful/clear: We aren't saying anyone *should* be held without bond or asserting that people with different demographic variables *should* be more likely to be held, but instead trying to predict whether people with different characteristics *are empirically more likely* to be held without bond, given the available information. This is the first step we would take in investigating whether a system is fair, or how large the disparities are: Does it treat people with similar observable characteristics similarly, or not? We are going to look at a common question: Are Black defendants treated differently from white or Asian ones? (There are Native American defendants, but there are 11 in total, which is such a small number of observations that is difficult to clearly say anything about how this group is treated relative to the others.)\n",
